## 📋 **COMPONENT STRUCTURE**

### **🏠 Homepage Implementation**
Homepage Flow:
src/app/page.tsx
└── src/components/ui/sections/MatchCenter.tsx (wrapper component)
├── @/features/matches/components/home/MatchCarousel.tsx (carousel logic)
│   ├── ../common/MatchCard.tsx (individual match cards)
│   └── ../common/LeaguePositionSummary.tsx (league position display)
├── @/features/matches/components/mobile/MobileMatchSection.tsx (mobile container)
│   ├── ./MobileMatchCard.tsx (mobile match cards with inactive states)
│   └── ./MobileLeagueTable.tsx (compact 3-team table)
├── @/features/galleries (MatchGalleryModal) (modal integration)
└── @/features/news/components (NewsModal) (modal integration)

**Key Features:**
- **Desktop**: 7-card carousel with arrow navigation and modal integration
- **Mobile**: 3-card stack (last result, next match, upcoming) with inactive icon states
- **Responsive**: Conditional rendering between desktop carousel and mobile cards
- **Icons**: Consistent Lucide React icons with proper inactive states

### **⚽ Matches Page Implementation**
Matches Page Flow:
src/app/matches/page.tsx
├── src/features/matches/components/MatchCentreContainer.tsx (main container)
│   ├── ./tabs/TabNavigation.tsx (fixtures/results/table tabs)
│   ├── ./filters/ (filtering system - shared across desktop/mobile)
│   └── ./panels/ (tab content with conditional rendering)
│       ├── FixturesPanel.tsx (desktop: FixtureCard, mobile: MobileFixtureCard)
│       ├── ResultsPanel.tsx (desktop: ResultCard, mobile: MobileResultCard)
│       └── TablePanel.tsx (desktop: full table, mobile: MobileTableCard)
└── src/features/matches/components/layout/MatchCentreHero.tsx (page header)

**Key Features:**

---

## 📱 **MOBILE ARCHITECTURE**

### **Mobile Components**
src/features/matches/components/mobile/
├── MobileMatchSection.tsx      # Homepage mobile container
├── MobileMatchCard.tsx         # Homepage mobile cards with inactive states
├── MobileLeagueTable.tsx       # Homepage compact league table (3 teams)
├── MobileFixtureCard.tsx       # Matches page fixture cards
├── MobileResultCard.tsx        # Matches page result cards
└── MobileTableCard.tsx         # Matches page full league table (18 teams)

### **Conditional Rendering Pattern**
```jsx
{/* Desktop: Existing desktop components */}
<div className="hidden md:block">
  <DesktopComponent />
</div>

{/* Mobile: Optimized mobile components */}
<div className="block md:hidden">
  <MobileComponent />
</div>
Mobile Design Standards

Touch Targets: 44px minimum for all interactive elements
Icon States: Active (navy) and inactive (grey) with proper disabled states
Borders: Consistent grey borders (border-[#e5e7eb]) across all cards
Headers: Competition names in navy headers (bg-[#00105A]) with white text
Team Names: Short names for space efficiency (team_short_name)


🔄 DATA FLOW
Homepage Data Sources

Hook: src/features/matches/hooks/useHomeMatchData.ts
Functions: getHomepageUpcomingMatches(5), getHomepageRecentMatches(5), getHomepageLeagueTable()
Database: Supabase views (vw_upcoming_matches, vw_latest_results, vw_current_league_table)
Mobile Data: Same data sources with mobile-optimized presentation

Matches Page Data Sources

Direct Supabase calls within panel components
Filter state management via URL search params (shared desktop/mobile)
Real-time filtering based on season/month/competition
Mobile rendering: Same data with device-specific card components


🎯 MODAL SYSTEM INTEGRATION
Modal Types Used

MatchGalleryModal: Photo galleries from completed matches
NewsModal: Match reports (linked via Sanity CMS)
Ticket Modals: External ticket links for upcoming matches

Modal Triggers

Homepage Desktop: MatchCard icons (gallery/report/ticket)
Homepage Mobile: MobileMatchCard icons with inactive states
Matches Page Desktop: FixtureCard/ResultCard icons
Matches Page Mobile: MobileFixtureCard/MobileResultCard icons
State Management: Page-level modal state passed down to all components


🎨 ICON SYSTEM STANDARDIZATION
Consistent Icon Implementation
Problem Solved: Mixed icon systems (inline SVG vs Lucide React)
Solution: Standardized on Lucide React across all components
Updated Components:

✅ FixtureCard.tsx: <Ticket> (was inline SVG)
✅ ResultCard.tsx: <FileText> and <Camera> (were inline SVGs)
✅ MobileMatchCard.tsx: <Camera>, <FileText>, <Ticket> with inactive states
✅ MobileFixtureCard.tsx: <Ticket> with inactive states
✅ MobileResultCard.tsx: <Camera> and <FileText> with inactive states

Icon States:
jsx// Active state
<Icon className="text-[#00105A] hover:text-[#FFD700]" />

// Inactive state  
<Icon className="text-[#9CA3AF] cursor-default" />
