      <p>Banks o' Dee manager Josh Winton has declared his squad "fully prepared" for Saturday's crucial Highland League clash against title rivals Buckie Thistle at Victoria Park.</p>
      
      <p>The match represents a critical juncture in the title race, with Banks o' Dee currently two points behind Buckie with seven games remaining in the season. A victory would see Winton's side leapfrog their opponents into first place.</p>
      
      <h2>Team News</h2>
      
      <p>Winton confirmed that captain Michael Williams has recovered from the hamstring strain that kept him out of last weekend's victory over Deveronvale and will return to the starting lineup. However, striker Robert Thompson remains sidelined with an ankle injury.</p>

We believe in our ability to take the game to them and impose our style. The key will be managing the crucial moments and maintaining our discipline throughout."</p>
      
      <p>The manager also highlighted the threat posed by Buckie's forwards, who have scored 12 goals in their last four matches: "They have real quality in the final third, so our defensive organization will need to be spot on. We've been working on specific strategies to counter their attacking threats."</p>
      
      <h2>Away Support</h2>
      
      <p>Banks o' Dee has sold its full allocation of 500 tickets for the match, ensuring strong away support at Victoria Park. Winton acknowledged the importance of the traveling fans: "Our supporters have been incredible all season, both at Spain Park and on the road.

      <p>Banks o' Dee FC is delighted to announce a new three-year kit partnership with renowned sports manufacturer Macron, beginning with the 2025/26 season. The deal represents the most significant kit partnership in the club's history and will see Macron supply playing kits, training wear, and replica merchandise for the first team, reserves, and all youth teams.</p>
      
      <h2>Bespoke Design</h2>
      
      <p>A key aspect of the partnership is Macron's commitment to creating bespoke designs specifically for Banks o' Dee, rather than using template kits.

Macron's willingness to work with us on completely custom designs set them apart from other manufacturers."</p>
      
      <p>The home, away, and third kits are currently being finalized in collaboration with a panel of supporters, ensuring fan input in the design process. The new kits will be unveiled at a special event in June.</p>
      
      <h2>Quality and Sustainability</h2>
      
      <p>Macron's reputation for quality was another important consideration, as Chairman Brian Winton explained: "When we evaluated potential partners, the durability and performance of the playing kits was paramount. Our players need apparel that can withstand the demands of a full season, and Macron's products consistently receive excellent feedback from clubs at all levels of the game."</p>
      
      <p>The partnership also includes a sustainability commitment, with the new kits being manufactured from Eco-Fabric, made from 100% recycled plastic bottles. Each shirt will represent approximately 13 recycled bottles, reflecting both clubs' commitment to environmental responsibility.</p>
      
      <h2>Commercial Impact</h2>
      
      <p>The deal is expected to significantly increase merchandise revenue for the club. The partnership includes investment in a completely redesigned club shop at Spain Park and an enhanced online retail presence.</p>
      
      <p>"We're excited about the commercial potential of this partnership," said Adams. "The combination of bespoke designs, improved quality, and better retail operations should drive a substantial increase in merchandise sales, providing important additional revenue for the club."</p>
      
      <p>Ross Cook, Macron UK Regional Manager, expressed his enthusiasm about the partnership: "Banks o' Dee is a club with growing ambitions and deep community roots, making them a perfect partner for Macron.
