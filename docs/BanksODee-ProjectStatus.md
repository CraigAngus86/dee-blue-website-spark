  - Error (`#EF4444`)
  - Info (`#3B82F6`)

### Typography
- **Font Families**:
  - Headings: Montserrat (300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800)
  - Body: Inter (300, 400, 500, 600, 700)

- **Font Sizes**:
  - Standardized scale from XS (0.75rem) to Display (3rem)
  - Consistent line heights (1.1-1.2 for headings, 1.4-1.6 for body text)

- **Text Components**:
  - `<Heading>` component with level props (1-6)
  - `<Text>` component with size, weight, and color props

### Interaction Patterns
- **Card Hover Effects**:
  - Subtle elevation (`hover:-translate-y-1`)
  - Shadow enhancement (`shadow-md` to `shadow-lg`)
  - Image scaling (`group-hover:scale-105`)
  - 300ms transition duration for animations
  - Background color shifts for interactive elements

- **Button Interactions**:
  - Clear hover/focus/active states
  - Color transitions for feedback
  - Optional icon animations

- **Link Behaviors**:
  - Underline on hover for inline links
  - Color transitions for navigation links
  - Icon movement for "Read More" links

### Architecture Decisions

- **Hybrid Data Strategy**: Using Supabase for operational data and Sanity CMS for editorial content
- **Cross-System References**: Standardized approach using 'supabaseId' fields in Sanity documents
- **Preview System**: Secure token-based preview for unpublished content
- **Asset Management**: Structured Cloudinary implementation with defined patterns
- **Caching Strategy**: In-memory caching with configurable TTL for performance

## Recent Improvements & Fixes
