## Known Issues & Areas for Refinement

### Component Issues
1. **NewsCard**:
   - Spacing between image and headline recently adjusted, may need further refinement

2. **MatchCard**:
   - Needs better handling for very long team names

3. **Hero Sections**:
   - Mobile responsiveness could be improved for some content layouts

### Backend Issues
1. **Cross-System References**:
   - Memory caching should be replaced with persistent caching for production
   - Additional entity-specific helpers needed for remaining content types

2. **Cloudinary Implementation**:
   - Some type definition issues have been fixed but require more comprehensive testing
   - Transform utility could benefit from further optimization and refactoring

3. **Preview Implementation**:
   - Currently structured for, but not integrated with, Next.js preview mode
   - Will need adaptation for production environment

### General Issues
1. **Image Optimization**:
   - Need to implement consistent loading states and fallbacks

2. **Performance**:
   - Bundle size optimization needed for faster loading

3. **Cross-browser Testing**:
   - Need comprehensive testing across all major browsers

## Next Steps & Development Priorities

### Short-term Priorities
1. **Next.js Migration**:
   - Initialize Next.js project with App Router
   - Migrate components to Next.js structure
   - Implement API routes for backend functionality
   - Integrate preview functionality with Next.js

2. **Content Pages**:
   - Complete the Fixtures & Results page
   - Complete the Club History page
   - Complete the News listing page with filters

3. **Component Refinement**:
